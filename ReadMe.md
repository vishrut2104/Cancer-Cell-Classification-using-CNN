• Developed two deep neural networks achieving an impressive accuracy of 88% to classify 100x100 pixel images of cell nuclei into one of four types.
• Utilized a custom ConvNet and a pre-trained torchvision model with transfer learning, saving time and resources while maintaining high performance.
• Carried out hyperparameter optimization using Ray Tune, resulting in a 3% improvement in accuracy and fine-tuning key model parameters. 
• Created confusion matrices to diagnose and resolve prediction confusion reducing misclassifications. Leveraged captum to interpret model behaviour and enhance transparency.
